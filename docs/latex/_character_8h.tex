\item The character is the main player of the game. Each character has a bunch of characteristics(attributes) and they can perform some actions as well(methods). If the character\textquotesingle{}s attributes gets updated, it will notify its \doxylink{class_character_observer}{Character\+Observer}.
\item The design of the character class in two files\+: First is the .h file to define the attributes and .cpp to do the implementation of the methods which is the most basic design for each class.
\item The libraries used are cstdlib for randomization of the ability score and iostream library for basic use of classes and functions. \doxylink{class_character}{Character} is movable because it can move and observable because it is observed by the \doxylink{class_character_observer}{Character\+Observer}.
